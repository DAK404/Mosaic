The tools which were written for Unix were not upto
the mark. For this reason, the Unix tools were removed
completely so that it can be written to be neat and fast.

The tools which need to be developed for Unix:

BuildScript.sh
Run_Program.sh
Reset.sh
MakeDoc.sh

If anyone is willing to do it, it would be really helpful!
