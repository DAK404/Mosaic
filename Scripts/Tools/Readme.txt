These tools are used to optionally ship builds which are encrypted.
This means that specific builds cannot be accessed publicly without
decrypting it.

Generally Early Builds are shipped in this way so that it can ensure
that the experimental features cannot be exploited in anyway or tamper
with the builds for malicious uses.

Nonetheless, the code will always remain opensource, and the program
will be updated with newer code and features once they are stable
enough for everyday use. If you would volunteer to test out in early
builds, please get in touch with me through appropriate channels.

Cheers!
DAK.
