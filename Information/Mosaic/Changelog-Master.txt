  _______________________________________________________

  [ IMPROVEMENTS ]

  * Updated the program to conform to the Nion Program
    specification.
  * Bumped version to 0.9.0.
  * Lots of code cleanup, removed many unwanted code
    which had no significant impact in functionality.
  * Stopped importing the API and Core libraries
    for all the modules in the program.
  * Reduced the memory usage by importing the required
    Java modules and not importing all the modules.
  * Added instances of the Garbage collector after
    specific statements to reduce the memory usage
    and for good memory optimization.
  * Minor documentation improvements and updates.

  [ FIXED ]

  * Fixed a bug in the LoginAPI program where the
    connection, PreparedStatement and ResultSet was not
    closed.
  * Fixed an issue when FCAD could not be found at rare
    cases.
  * Memory leak in some of the Anima classes which could
    be exploited to snoop at the transactions.
  * Trimmed the trailing white spaces and changed
    indentation from tabs to spaced for uniformity.

  [ REMOVED ]

  * Removed redundant SecureBoot variables across
    programs and the modules.

  [ KNOWN ISSUES ]

  * Setup program will fail to create directories
    if Truncheon or other programs have created the
    /System and /Users directories, and abort the
    setup process completely.

  * Truncheon's launcher will fail to invoke Mosaic
    due to the newer architecture. Fixes are being
    worked on.

  - WON'T FIX -

  * There is a security issue regarding the Login
    method in the Boot program. This issue will not
    be fixed since the issue has been mitigated
    Truncheon.
  * Further security issues regarding the setup and
    Boot program has been found which will not be
    addressed, since the same has been changed in
    Truncheon.
